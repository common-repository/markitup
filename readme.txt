MarkitUp (beta) is a wordpress plugin which allows you to use Markdown on your site without breaking existing content

== Description ==

MarkItUp (beta) allows for you to use Markdown on your Wordpress site.

It does this on a per-author basis and per-post. This means that you shouldn't be accidently converting other people's posts/pages into Markdown by accident!

Currently this wears the beta label because it could have little bumps which aren't smoothed out just yet.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the directory `markitup` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What about my existing content using complex markup? =

The Wordpress default editor will be used

= Not all of my authors like Markdown, is that a problem? =

Currently each author has to manually enable it in their settings, so there is nothing to worry about

= I want Feature X, Y or Z =

Do let me know on Twitter http://twitter.com/kennydude

= How do I center align my images? =

This is on a site-wide basis and can be enabled by going to Settings -> Writing and there is a "MarkItUp" section.

== Screenshots ==

Soon! (Once I leave beta!)
